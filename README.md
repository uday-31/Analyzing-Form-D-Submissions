# fds-ii-project


The final project will be due on Sunday, December 4 at 9:00 PM 11:59 PM. You will submit your results via Canvas.


The Groups

You will do the work in groups of four, except where necessary groups may have five students.

The process for forming groups will be as follows: You will be allowed to pair up with one other student (from your same campus). I will create the final groups by joining up two of these pairs. Both members of the pair need to agree to be paired up. 

If you do not want to pair up with another student, you do not need to. In this case I will just assign you to a group myself.

You will create these pairs by going to https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/31966/groups#tab-14162
You and your pairmate need to join the same “group,” making sure that you choose one appropriately labeled “NYC” or “PGH.” You must complete the pairing by Tuesday, November 15 at 5:00 PM. If you have not done it by then, you will not be allowed to join a pair. Remember that both members of the pair must take action on Canvas for this to work; it is not sufficient for one group member to express that they want to be paired with someone.

Important: If you say/email something to me such as “Can my pair be combined with X and Y to form the group?” you will guarantee that your request will not be granted, because I will want to ensure that there is no appearance of such requests being granted.

The final group assignments will be announced on Wednesday, November 16.


The Work

This course includes a discussion of a range of methods:

1. Nonparametric smoothing (density estimation and regression)

2. Dimension reduction (PCA and nonlinear methods)

3. Clustering

4. Hypothesis Testing

5. Bayesian estimation

6. Natural language processing

For this project, we will return to the data set that was the subject of Homework 1. You will recall that in Homework 2 I asked you to propose interesting research questions that could be addressed using these data. I have created a list of the best questions, edited as needed. These questions are listed below.

Your job is to choose four methods from the list above, and use each to address a question on the list. You can address four different questions, you can address fewer than four questions, but you must perform four different analyses using (at least) four different methods from the list. One response can use multiple methods (in fact this is encouraged), but each analysis must be distinct and fundamentally different.

You are also allowed to use linear regression and other tools learned in FDS as appropriate.

By “addressing a question,” I mean the following: Provide some evidence in support of a particular position on the question. Your response should be in a form that is generally understandable by a broad audience with expertise in finance, but not necessarily in advanced data science methods. I am not asking you to construct a definitive answer to the question, I am asking you to provide evidence in support of the answer. Imagine someone looking at your results and saying, “Yes, I now am persuaded that the evidence in support of your position is stronger than it was before.”

Emphasis should be placed on visualization of the results. Your visualizations should be clear and well-constructed.

There should not be technical results presented… no tables of regression coefficients or complex summaries. No use of neural networks, boosting, etc. If you are contemplating using such tools, you are thinking too complex. You will be assessed based on appropriateness of analysis and clear presentation, not on complexity.

Your submission should consist of two parts: The first is a pdf document that provides your evidence in support of each position. There should be at most two pages of text and figures for each response. (Use at least 11-point font.) The second part is a Jupyter notebook which performs the underlying analyses. This can be less formal and more technical, but it should be clear and complete. We should be able to run the notebook and reproduce your results.

Assessment

For each response you provide, you will be graded on these elements:
- Is the choice of method appropriate to addressing the question? (4 points)
- Is the analysis implemented appropriately? (8 points)
- Are the results presented clearly, including any visualization? (4 points)
- Are the results convincing and sufficiently nontrivial? (4 points)

A final component to the assessment will be an in-class portion on Monday, December 5 during the regular lecture time. This portion will be done individually, not in your groups. It will be designed to assess whether or not your have a good understanding of everything that your group has done during the project work. You will not be allowed to review your group’s results and/or submission during this assessment. This will count for 20 points.

Hence, the entire project will consist of 100 points.


Other

You are not allowed to interact or collaborate with students outside of your group on the work.

All group members are expected to contribute roughly equally to the work. All group members are responsible for all work that is submitted by their group.


Research Questions

These are the research questions that you can address for the final project.

1. Are there variables in the data set that could help predict the percentage of offering sold?

2. What relationships exist between the revenue range and the features of the offering, such as the type of securities, the type of industry which offerings belong to and the duration of offerings?

3. Are there variables that would be effective in predicting the total number of individuals who have already invested?

4. How does the relationship between the total amount sold and the total number of people who have already invested vary with the sale date?

5. Is there a change in the minimum investment accepted over time, and does this vary with industry?

6. Many offerings include “Decline to Disclose” for some variables. Are there some columns which would be easier to fill in “impute” than others?

7. Do investors show a preference for equity offerings, as compared to other types of offerings like debt or derivatives, keeping other factors constant?

8. To what extent does investment fund type influence the properties of the offering such as revenue range, total offering amount?

9. What is the relationship between the minimum investment accepted and the total amount sold, and how does it vary with other variables in the data set?
